== Description:

Taps is the the easiest way to push and pull data between
databases and this plugin makes taps just work in rails environments.

== Synopsis:

Taps plugin provides a script that will talk to your rails environment
to figure out your database configuration, start a taps
service, and pull data from other taps services.

Start a taps server by running:

    script/taps server bobdobbs secret

By default, this will start a taps server on port 5000. You can then
pull from this taps server at another location by using the taps script:

    script/taps pull http://bobdobbs:secret@taps.server.host:5000

You can also run the taps_server script on a different port and log
debug messages:

    script/taps server --port 3000 --debug bobdobbs secret

You can also pull just some tables without compression:

    script/taps pull --disable-compression --tables=Posts,Users http://bobdobbs:secret@liveapp.host:5000

You can explore even more options in the usage messages from running the taps script.

== Requirements:

* rails 3.0
* taps 0.3

== Installing:

Install the taps plugin in your rails 3 app by going to the application
directory and running:

    rails plugin install http://github.com/josephholsten/taps_plugin.git

Then generate the taps scripts, by running the generator:

    rails generate taps

== Rails 2

This plugin is designed to work with Rails 3, but most people aren't ready to
make the leap so the taps plugin still works with a little effort. The
generator only works in Rails 3, you'll need to add the taps script by hand.
Just save this code in +script/taps+:

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    require File.expand_path('../../config/environment',  __FILE__)
    require 'taps_plugin'
    TapsPlugin::Command.start(ARGV)

Make sure to make it executable and the script should work as normal.

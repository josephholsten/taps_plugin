Taps Plugin
==========

Taps Plugin is the the easiest way to push and pull data between
databases and this plugin makes taps just work in rails environments.
It provides a taps_server script that will talk to your rails
environment to figure out your database configuration and start a taps
service you can push and pull data across.


Example
=======

To install the taps scripts, run the generator:

    rails generate taps

Then start a taps server by running:

    script/taps_server jappleseed secret

By default, this will start a taps server on port 5000. You can then
pull from this taps server at another location by using the
taps_pull script:

    script/taps_pull http://jappleseed:secret@taps.server.host:5000

You can also run the taps_server script on a different port and log
debug messages:

    script/taps_server --port 3000 --debug jappleseed secret
